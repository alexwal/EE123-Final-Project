# EE123-Final-Project
### Radio transmission and wavelet compression
In the good old days, one could *simply* hookup a special EE123 radio and transmitter and transmit images by running `python transmit.py`. Another special hooked up EE123 radio and transmitter could receive those images with `python receive.py`. Different from most projects which used the DCT or RLE, this project uses the wavelet transform common to JPEG2000, an underappreciated modern image format.
